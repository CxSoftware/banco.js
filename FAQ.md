Why?
----

Sadly, most banks don't offer a standard API for customers to access
their information. What they do provide is a website, so this is a
small attempt to create a standard API for (Chilean) banks.

What's the API?
---------------

Please read the API file for more information about the stndard
API that each bank should implement.

Is this secure?
---------------

Short answer: yes

Long answer: You must understand that your credentials and access
to your bank are sensitive data. If you can, check the source code
first to make sure it does everything you need to and nothing else.
